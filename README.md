# 🚗 Used Car Quality Detection

## 📚 Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that evaluates the quality of used cars based on various features. By analyzing historical data, we can predict the likelihood of a car being in good condition.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of various features, including:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Condition
- Price

You can download the dataset from [here](link-to-dataset).
